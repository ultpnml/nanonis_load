A library of routines for importing Nanonis SPM data files into a Python 2.7 environment.  The data can then be plotted and analyzed.

The following file types are supported:
*.dat Bias Spectroscopy files read by get_spectra(FILENAME) in "didv.py"
*.3ds Grid Spectroscopy files read by load_nanonis_3ds(FILENAME) in "grid.py"
*.sxm Image files read by load_sxm(FILENAME) in "sxm.py"


plot_spectra() in "didv.py" plots .dat bias spectroscopy files.
plot_nanonis_3ds() in "grid.py" plots .3ds grid spectroscopy files.
plot_sxm() in "sxm.py" plots .sxm image files.
